After cloning the repository, you must first enter the folder containing the cloned repository. If an IDE is being used, this can be done through the IDE itself, however, if not, then the following commands can be used to run the program through the terminal: \\ 

for Linux and Mac:
\begin{verbatim}
    cd Dynamic-Programming-and-the-Periodic-Table
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py    
\end{verbatim}

for Windows:
\begin{verbatim}
    cd Dynamic-Programming-and-the-Periodic-Table
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
\end{verbatim}

The program should then execute! Cheers!
